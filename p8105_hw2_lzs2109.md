### **Problem 1**

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

``` r
mtw_df = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                    range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))

precip18_df = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
                    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

precip19_df = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                    sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
                    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)

precip_df = bind_rows(precip18_df, precip19_df) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  relocate(month, year)
```

The Mr. Trash Wheel and precipitation data sets both come from the same
excel file about Baltimore’s Mr. Trash Wheel, a device that collects
trash from Jones Falls river as it enters Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. The
trash is then incinerated to provide power to the Baltimore area. The
Trash Wheel data set includes temporal details, info on the mass of
trash collected, and type of trash collected by the device per dumpster
filled, in addition to estimates of power generated as a result. The
variables included in the dataset are dumpster, month, year, date,
weight\_tons, volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles, polystyrene,
cigarette\_butts, glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags, chip\_bags,
sports\_balls, homes\_powered, and includes info on 344 different
dumpsters filled with trash collected by the device, each denoted by a
different row. For example, Mr. Trash Wheel collected a median of 8
sports balls in 2017. The precipitation data set includes information
about how much rain was measured per month for the years 2018 and 2019.
This is important because the Mr. Trash Wheel website indicates that the
level of precipitation influences the amount and type of trash the
device collects. Variables in the precipitation dataset include month,
year, total, and there is data for all twelve months in 2018 and up to
June of 2019. For example, in 2018 there was a total of 70.33 inches of
rain for the year.

### **Problem 2**

``` r
pols_df = read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month), 
         month = month.name[month],
         year = as.numeric(year),
         president = ifelse(prez_dem == 1, "dem", "gop")) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

``` r
snp_df = read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>% 
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month), 
         month = month.name[month],
         year = as.numeric(year),
         year = ifelse(year > 40, year + 1900, year + 2000)) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  relocate(year, month)
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2

``` r
unemp_df = read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
  Jan:Dec,
  names_to = "month",
  values_to = "percent_unemployed") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(month_nums = rep(1:12, length(month)/12),
         month_nums = month.name[month_nums],
         month = month_nums) %>% 
  select(-month_nums)
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13

    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec

``` r
pols_snp_df = left_join(pols_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month")) 
#merge pol_df and snap_df by year and month keys
pols_snp_unemp_df = left_join(pols_snp_df, unemp_df, by = c("year", "month"))
#merging unemp_df with same keys
```

These three dataset contain information and data surrounding politics
and history in the United States. The pols dataframe contains info on
the number of senators, governors, and representatives from 1947 to 2015
grouped by their political affiliation, republican or democrat. It also
included political affiliation of the president until we merged the dem
and gop columns into one president column (for which there are two
during Aug-Dec 1974, presumably when Nixon was impeached and Ford took
office). The snp dataframe contains data on the closing numbers of the
S&P stock market index for every month between 1950 to 2015, as a
general measure of the state of the economy during those times. Finally,
the unemployment dataframe includes the percentage of unemployment in
the U.S. for months between the years 1948 to 2015. Since these three
datasets incorporate which political party held more power during any
given month/year, the state of the economy by a general measure, and the
percent of unemployed, it seemed interesting to merge them and compare
how political party’s power may have affected the economy and
unemployment rates. The resulting dataframe incorporates 822
observations for the variables year, month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop,
rep\_gop, gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president, close,
percent\_unemployed between the years 1947 to 2015.

                                                  "BLACK NON HISPANIC" = "BLACK NON HISP",
