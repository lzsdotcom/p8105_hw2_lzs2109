### **Problem 1**

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

``` r
mtw_df = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                    range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

``` r
precip18_df = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
                    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018, Month = month.name)

precip19_df = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                    sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
                    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019, Month = month.name)

precip_df = bind_rows(precip18_df, precip19_df) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  relocate(month, year)
```

The Mr. Trash Wheel and precipitation data sets both come from the same
excel file about Baltimore’s Mr. Trash Wheel, a device that collects
trash from Jones Falls river as it enters Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. The
trash is then incinerated to provide power to the Baltimore area. The
Trash Wheel data set includes temporal details, info on the mass of
trash collected, and type of trash collected by the device per dumpster
filled, in addition to estimates of power generated as a result. The
variables included in the dataset are dumpster, month, year, date,
weight\_tons, volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles, polystyrene,
cigarette\_butts, glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags, chip\_bags,
sports\_balls, homes\_powered, and includes info on 344 different
dumpsters filled with trash collected by the device, each denoted by a
different row. For example, Mr. Trash Wheel collected a median of 8
sports balls in 2017. The precipitation data set includes information
about how much rain was measured per month for the years 2018 and 2019.
This is important because the Mr. Trash Wheel website indicates that the
level of precipitation influences the amount and type of trash the
device collects. Variables in the precipitation dataset include month,
year, total, and there is data for all twelve months in 2018 and up to
June of 2019. For example, in 2018 there was a total of 70.33 inches of
rain for the year.
